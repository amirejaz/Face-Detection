# How to Train YOLOv5 on Custom Objects

This tutorial is based on the [YOLOv5 repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) by [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/). This notebook shows training on **your own custom objects**. Many thanks to Ultralytics for putting this repository together - we hope that in combination with clean data management tools at Roboflow, this technologoy will become easily accessible to any developer wishing to use computer vision in their projects.

### Accompanying Blog Post

We recommend that you follow along in this notebook while reading the blog post on [how to train YOLOv5](https://blog.roboflow.ai/how-to-train-yolov5-on-a-custom-dataset/), concurrently.

### Steps Covered in this Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps required to train YOLOv5 on your custom objects. We use a [public blood cell detection dataset](https://public.roboflow.ai/object-detection/bccd), which is open source and free to use. You can also use this notebook on your own data.

To train our detector we take the following steps:

* Install YOLOv5 dependencies
* Download custom YOLOv5 object detection data
* Write our YOLOv5 Training configuration
* Run YOLOv5 training
* Evaluate YOLOv5 performance
* Visualize YOLOv5 training data
* Run YOLOv5 inference on test images
* Export saved YOLOv5 weights for future inference



### **About**

[Roboflow](https://roboflow.com) enables teams to deploy custom computer vision models quickly and accurately. Convert data from to annotation format, assess dataset health, preprocess, augment, and more. It's free for your first 1000 source images.

We'll download our dataset from Roboflow. Use the "**YOLOv5 PyTorch**" export format. Note that the Ultralytics implementation calls for a YAML file defining where your training and test data is. The Roboflow export also writes this format for us.

To get your data into Roboflow, follow the [Getting Started Guide](https://blog.roboflow.ai/getting-started-with-roboflow/).

### Next, we'll fire off training!


Here, we are able to pass a number of arguments:
- **img:** define input image size
- **batch:** determine batch size
- **epochs:** define the number of training epochs. (Note: often, 3000+ are common here!)
- **data:** set the path to our yaml file
- **cfg:** specify our model configuration
- **weights:** specify a custom path to weights. (Note: you can download weights from the Ultralytics Google Drive [folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Drs_Aiu7xx6S-ix95f9kNsA6ueKRpN2J))
- **name:** result names
- **nosave:** only save the final checkpoint
- **cache:** cache images for faster training

Training losses and performance metrics are saved to Tensorboard and also to a logfile defined above with the **--name** flag when we train. In our case, we named this `yolov5s_results`.

Note from Glenn: Partially completed `results.txt` files can be plotted with `from utils.utils import plot_results; plot_results()`.
